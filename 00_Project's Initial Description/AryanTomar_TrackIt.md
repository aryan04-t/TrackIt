# Project's Initial Description 


## Aryan Tomar: 12109523 


### Project Name: TrackIt



- What problem is solved by TrackIt? 

    - TrackIt aims to address multiple aspects of an individual's life by providing a centralized platform for tracking and managing daily activities related to physical health, financial health, social relations, and task management. 
    
    - It seeks to simplify and streamline the process of monitoring and improving these key areas of life. 



- What are the similar existing solutions?

    - MyFitnessPal or Cronometer for calorie and protein intake tracking.
    - Mint or YNAB for personal expense tracking.
    - Google Calendar or specialized reminder apps for events like birthdays and anniversaries.
    - Evernote or Microsoft OneNote for note-taking and task management.



- How TrackIt is different then these existing similar solutions?

    - TrackIt aims to provide a comprehensive solution by integrating all four aspects into a single user-friendly MERN stack application. The mobile-friendly interface ensures accessibility, and the use of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) facilitates efficient development and scalability. The application will utilize a clean and intuitive design to enhance the user experience.
    
    - Whatever similar solutions exist, they're not a centralized platform for all these things. 



- List of major key features that I will be implementing in TrackIt: 

        My project will provide 1 interface which will have 4 sections, and each section has a different purpose, you can consider each section as a individual major feature of the project.
